        "Are you finding food complicated?\n\nWe have 5 tips for getting you back on track.\n\nOur approach to food can feel complicated. Like any relationship in life, maintaining a positive relationship with food requires a lifelong commitment.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to diet, but there are some simple ways to improve your approach. Finding a sustainable route to food contentment doesn’t have to be hard!\n\nHere are 5 tips to help improve your approach to your diet.\n\n1. AVOID LABELING FOODS ‘GOOD’ OR ‘BAD’\n\nWhen we label foods ‘good’, we label others ‘bad’ by default. By suggesting that food (or a food group) is ‘bad’, we are suggesting that it isn’t okay to consume those foods- full stop. We know the long-term effects of over-consuming foods high in sugar, fat, and salt; however, enjoying these foods in moderation, without the guilt, allows us to find more balance when it comes to diet. When food is no longer off-limits, our relationship with that food changes for the better!\n\n2. UNDERSTAND YOUR HUNGER\n\nUnlike our hunter-gatherer ancestors before us, food is now more convenient than ever.\n\nThe second we feel the first pangs of hunger, we can sate them; this means we are less likely to listen to the natural signals our body sends us. We’ve forgotten how to be intuitive!\n\nSo how can we differentiate?\n\nSome ways to check-in:\n\n# Perform a mental scan of your body- what is your physical and emotional state? Do you need comfort? Are you bored?\n\n# Try to learn the fluctuations of your body- these can be hormonal, sleeprelated, or levels of physical activity. For example, you might feel more hungry at certain points of your menstrual cycle, when your body requires more energy.\n\n# Ensure you’re adequately hydrated! Sometimes we can mistake thirst for hunger, reaching for food when all we really need is a glass of water.\n\n3. K.I.S.S\n\nKeep It Simple and Sustainable!\n\nIn other words- strip it back to basics. When we overcomplicate food, sustainable habits become hard work. There are various ways to overcomplicate food, but some examples might include:\n\n# Eliminating food groups such as fat or carbs.\n\n# Avoiding snacking\n\n# Restricting eating times or only eating at specific times in the day.\n\nThere are valid reasons why people might adopt the above approaches. If you have a specific goal or routine (such as a competition), food intolerance, or illness, some (or all) of the above might be necessary for you.\n\nRemember to always check with a qualified health professional. However, for most people- keeping it simple is the key:\n\n# Focus on a calorie deficit or calorie maintenance – if you’re looking to lose, or maintain, weight.\n\n# Eat a varied and balanced diet, full of colour.\n\n# Eat in moderation.\n\n4. CHECK YOUR SUPPLEMENTS\n\nSupplements can help us to fulfil our nutritional needs, but over-supplementing is very common.\n\nWe can get most of the vitamins and nutrients we need from a balanced and varied diet. However, there may be occasions (as we get older or modify our diet or lifestyle) when we might be unable to meet this quota.\n\nB12 is a common example. As we get older, we produce less stomach acid which makes it harder to extract B12 from food.\n\nAnyone vegan or vegetarian may find it harder to access B12, as it is mostly found in animal products.\n\nThis is when supplements can be very useful!\n\nMake sure you’re aware of the supplements you need and check in with a health professional before you proceed.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWe have a wealth of information available to us, so it is easy to see why we can get caught up in the latest advice or diet trends!\n\nGoing back to basics helps us to realign with the needs of our body.\n\nKeep it simple! Sometimes less is more."

        "Simplify your life.\n\nWe provide our top tips for being happier by doing less.\n\nWe’re all guilty of not giving ourselves enough ‘me’ time. It’s easy to think happiness always stems from ‘doing’- making plans, buying things, getting busy- but sometimes doing less can help us find true happiness. Occasionally, we just need to switch off, get some rest, and simply be. If you’re not sure where to start, here are our top tips on how to do less and be happy more.\n\n1. MAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF\n\nWhether it’s work, family, or a combination of factors, we can be terrible at prioritizing ourselves! It always feels as though there’s something to be done.\n\nOUR TIP: Find time in your day, or week, to put time aside for yourself. Whether it’s running a bath, applying a facemask, reading a book, or listening to a podcast; having some time to yourself can bring some peace and calm. When we take the body down from stress mode, we recharge; this helps to improve sleep and energy levels, which can also make us feel happier.\n\n22. TAKE A HOLIDAY FROM WORK\n\nBusy careers are not easy to step away from, but taking a break is a necessity! You don’t have to book a flight to have a holiday.\n\nTOUR TIP: Book some time out from work to be with loved ones. Whether you’re looking for relaxation or there are some personal things to catch up on, taking a break from work can help you to find life balance. In fact, according to research into social interaction, we are wired to feel connected to others- a lifestyle pillar responsible for our physical and mental well-being.\n\n3. MIX UP YOUR EXERCISE ROUTINE\n\nWe know how important exercise is for our mental and physical well-being, but recovery days are equally as important for happiness. Overtraining can lead to increased risk of injury, training plateaus, and burnout.\n\nOUR TIP: Try adding recovery days in for some active rest. This could be a gentle jog, swimming, long walks, or even a bike ride with the family. Moving the body gets the endorphins flowing- meaning you’ll feel happier!\n\n4. FIND YOUR INNER CHILD\n\nAs adults, we often forget to be playful. However, the simple pleasures of being young can bring us a great sense of happiness. Switching off the critical mind and living in the present moment could be your answer!\n\n3OUR PRO TIP: Simple child-like experiences such as picking flowers, playing games, or revisiting childhood joys can be a great way to remember that the little things matter the most. Visualization exercises can be a useful tool for mentally checking back in with the inner child. \n\n5. SLEEP!\n\nWe should be aiming for around 7-9 hours of sleep (on average) a night, but most of us struggle to achieve it! Sleep is when our body recovers and rebuilds; it plays a crucial role in the optimal functioning of our body’s systems.\n\nOUR TIP: Try to aim for at least 7 hours of sleep a night. If you can, napping is a great way to get extra shut-eye allowing for a much needed recharge of the batteries.\n\nOUR TAKEAWAY\n\nAs we get older, we tend to believe that doing more means we’re achieving more. But true happiness comes when we are in our most rested and rejuvenated statenot through burnout. One of the most productive things we can do is take the time to do less- we promise it can make you happier!"
